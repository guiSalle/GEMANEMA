# GEMANEMA

This repository contains R scripts used to analyse observations gathered from genetically divergent sheep lines exposed to contrasted environments.
Two scripts are available:
- paper_sheep_git.R: Analysis of divergence and GxE interactions in sheep .
- paper_worm_git.R: provides the analytical workflow applied to RNAseq and DNAseq data produced from worms collected in each resistant/susceptible sheep background.

# GEMANEMA

This repository contains R scripts used to analyse observations gathered from genetically divergent sheep lines exposed to contrasted environments.
Analysis of divergence and GxE interactions in sheep are within the paper_sheep_git.R script.
The other script (paper_worm_git.R) provides the analytical workflow applied to RNAseq and DNAseq data produced from worms collected in each resistant/susceptible sheep background.
